title: Refreshing the Blog
---

{% raw %}

I've noticed that this blog has gotten quite stale. Even during the time where I was posting the most frequently I didn't really update it that often, but with my blog now being referenced on Wikipedia I feel as though I have a duty to do some housekeeping.

I've completely rewritten my _About_ page. It's a bit lengthy, but I'm not really good at writing about myself without telling my entire life's story. I've also removed my link to Twitter, which I had deleted way back when Musk first took it over. I've since then moved to Mastodon, which I've enjoyed!

I plan on doing future posts on the following topics:

* An Introduction to Neutral-Atom Quantum Computing
* Some kind of copilot/gen-ai rant
* Using graph techniques to uncover hidden meanings in Sleep Token songs

I also want to have a unique tag/category for essentially _gist_ information. I have amassed quite a bit of useful information for very select groups of people that are otherwise too brief for a full blog post. I also want to add some of my poetry and other creative works.
