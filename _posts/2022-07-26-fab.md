# Background

About four months ago I decided to get back into
[Yu-Gi-Oh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu-Gi-Oh!_Trading_Card_Game), a popular
trading card game and obsession of middle school Harrison. My return to the game
wasn't physical but rather digitally via the recently released [Yu-Gi-Oh Master
Duel](https://www.konami.com/yugioh/masterduel/us/en/). You see, Master Duel
provided a nostalgic window into my younger years without necessary financial
investment. I can't help but see it as a marketed form of escapist
[chronoportation](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/chronoportation#English) aimed
at my generation, but that topic is outside the scope of this post. For the sake
of brevity I'll just say that my experience with the game was not very positive,
or rather my experience was not at all like the game I remembered as a kid.
Modern _Yu-Gi-Oh_ is [very much a different
game](https://www.reddit.com/r/YuGiOhMasterDuel/comments/s90vkf/the_modern_yugioh_experience/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
dominated by [extensive combos](https://roadoftheking.com/dd-advance-combo/)
resulting in a board state that aims to prevent your opponent from being able to
play the game. Thus the typical player experience is as follows:

* If you're going first: spend the next 10 mins running through your combo guide
  to set up your desired board state (or until the opponent resigns).
* If you're going second: either wait the 10 mins to see if your opponent made
  any mistakes in their combo, or resign so that you can have a chance at
  another coin flip to go first.
  
I could probably spend an entire article dissecting the issues of the modern
_Yu-Gi-Oh_ metagame, but instead I would like to just focus on how dispirited I
felt about the game after playing it at Platinum rank for a couple of months. I
wasn't dissuaded from trading card games in general though (after all, I
remembered early _Yu-Gi-Oh_ quite fondly), and thus I began to search for
trading card games with the following core principles of a "fun" card game in
mind:

1. It should make you feel like you always have something to do or think about
   without getting bored. Turns should be quick with a lot of back-and-forth
   motion between the players.
2. Combos are fun, but they shouldn't be so complex that the average person
   couldn't commit them to memory after reading them for a few minutes.
3. Strategy should largely unfold over the course of a game, not over the course
   of a single turn.
4. The game should avoid "omni-cards" that see utility in every deck. Deck
   composition should be as fluid as possible.
5. Card rarity should largely be a collector's concern. Common cards should see
   as much utility as rare cards.
6. The game should avoid "dead cards" (aka
   [Garnets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j858y8gqacQ)). Every card in your
   hand should have multiple purposes.
7. The game should be impossible to win on the first two turns. Going second
   should not feel like a disadvantage.
8. (Bonus) The game should have a large enough player base and general support
   to make the investment of time and money worth it.

After peering into the metas of multiple TCGs, only one game stood out that
appeared to uphold all of my established principles: _Flesh and Blood_.


# Flesh and Blood

[Flesh and Blood](https://fabtcg.com/) (FaB) is a relatively new trading card
game with a decisive mission statement:

> Our mission is to bring people together in the flesh and blood through the
> common language of playing great games.

> Flesh and Blood rewards good decisions, not good luck. With our game, we seek
> to challenge the fundamental laws of TCG card evaluation and deck building
> philosophies. Itâ€™s highly interactive, with action beginning from the very
> first turn. The game is built around a unique resource system, underpinning an
> innovative combat dynamic which has been rigorously tested by competitive TCG
> fanatics.

In addition to meeting all of the core principles above, FaB distinguishes
itself with some very interesting mechanical decisions. A game of FaB emulates
the battle between two "heroes" in a fantasy setting - essentially characters
you might create in a RPG. Each hero has a collection of equipment (their armor
and weapon) and a deck of "attacks" or "spells" which is drawn from and played
during each players turn. Each player starts the game with all of their
equipment already "equipped" to their hero, which is then destroyed as needed
during the act of playing the game. Because of this, you actually start the game
at your _strongest_ and weaken over time. This one choice of mechanics
eliminates the typical rush to establish a desired board state in games like
_Yu-Gi-Oh_. Another interesting departure is the concept of drawing cards at the
_end_ of your turn, forcing you to defend yourself on your opponent's turn
_before_ you get to go on the offensive. You also draw into a new hand
(typically four cards) every turn rather than drawing a single card, which
reduces the impact of in-hand [card
advantage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_advantage). Furthermore each card
(with some exceptions, of course) may be:

1. Played to activate its effect or deal damage to the opponent.
2. "Pitched" to pay for the cost of another card.
3. Used to defend against an opponent's attack.

When a card is played or defended with, it is typically discarded to the
_graveyard_ where it (usually) remains for the rest of the game. Pitching a card
to pay for the cost of another card, however, cycles it into the bottom of the
deck so that it may be drawn again in the future. This mechanic instills the
sense that the card is not "wasted" by using it to pay for something else.

Needless to say, I was immediately hooked. _Flesh and Blood_ is easily the most
fun I've ever had playing a card game. Each game feels fast-paced and balanced,
with most matches in my experience ending in something 2 to 0 (health out of
typically 20), regardless of the heroes involved. Of course this game _does_
have some issues in more competitive settings, particularly around certain
equipment, but these issues are nowhere near the magnitude encountered when I
was playing _Yu-Gi-Oh_ (okay I promise I'll stop complaining about that game
from here on out).

So why am I writing a blog post about it? Clearly I must have found some way to
incorporate computers or mathematics into my newfound passion, right?

You're _damn_ right I did!


# Introducing `fab`

Recently over the past month or so, I poured ... hold on ...

```
~/projects/fab  >  cat $(find . -type f -name '*.py') | wc -l
6448
```

... 6448 lines of Python into a module (and accompanying Jupyter notebook
environment) called [fab](https://github.com/HarrisonTotty/fab) for the express
purpose of analyzing FaB card data. The goal is to develop a computational
mechanism by which one may monitor the integrity of FaB's metagame as it evolves
over time. By developing computational methods to identify and expose flaws in
the game, I believe we can better ensure the long-term integrity of FaB's
mission statement.

I am reminded of a talking point from [this SAINTCON keynote by the
LockPickingLawyer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH0GXWQDk0Q) in which LPL
describes that much of (lack of) security in the world of locksmiths is defined
by the obscurity and secrecy in which the trade normally operates. In short most
locks are laughably bad, lock companies know this, and the industry relies on
that few know of that fact. The truth is however, that bad actors with malicious
intent will inevitably learn how to bypass the physical security of the locks
regardless of the general public's knowledge on the subject. I argue that the
same can be said about the mechanics of trading card games. I presume there
either exists or will exist closed-source programs which may be purchased to
simulate millions of games in popular TCGs like _Magic: The Gathering_ with the
goal to produce the deck statistically most likely to win at tournaments. I also
presume (tin-foil hat time) that there either exists or will exist deep learning
implementations of these simulators which could produce patterns and strategies
less likely to be caught with more traditional methods. Those with the money to
purchase (or technical knowledge to create) these simulators are (in my opinion)
effectively at an unfair advantage over those that can't. So what do we do about
it? Well I would argue we do for _Flesh and Blood_ what LPL did for the locksmith
industry: develop a free, open source method by which we may computationally
test the current metagame for vulnerabilities and "patch" them before they
become too widespread. Ideally, [Legend Story Studios](https://legendstory.com/)
(the creators of FaB) could run concept cards through the simulator to weed out
any obvious game-breaking cards before internal playtests even begin.

At the time of writing this post, `fab` isn't quite at the point of being able
to simulate games (even in a basic sense), but it does provides the groundwork
for analyzing the game in a traditional sense.


## Basic Data Structures: `Card` & `CardList` Objects

Card data in `fab` is backed by the excellent work done by the
[flesh-cube/flesh-and-blood-cards](https://github.com/flesh-cube/flesh-and-blood-cards)
repository. This data is imported and converted into
[Card](https://fablib.readthedocs.io/cards/), and their associated collection
[CardList](https://fablib.readthedocs.io/card-lists/). A basic typical workflow
of importing and working with these objects might look something like this:

```python
from fab import Card, CardList

# Import all cards from disk into a `CardList` object. By specifying
# `set_catalog=True`, we are also telling the module that this object contains
# information for all cards, and thus may be referenced implicitly via some
# supporting methods.
all_cards = CardList.load('~/data/cards.json', set_catalog=True)

# One such supporting method is the ability to instantiate a card by its name.
prism = Card.from_full_name('Prism')

# `Card` objects are dataclasses.
print(f'{prism.health}, {prism.intelligence}') # 20, 4

# `CardList` objects have methods for sorting and filtering cards. The following
# would contain all Generic, Light, and Light Illusionist cards sorted by attack
# power.
supporting_cards = all_cards.filter(
  types=['Light', 'Illusionist', 'Generic']
).filter(types='Warrior', negate=True).sort(key='power', reverse=True)

# `CardList` objects subclass `collections.UserList`, so all of the usual
# pythonic list workflows work.
for card in supporting_cards[:10]:
  if card.is_attack():
    print(f'{card.name}: {card.power}') # Prints name & power of first 10 cards
```

You pretty much get the idea. `Card` is a particular FaB card and `CardList` is
a list of cards. However both `Card` and `CardList` objects provide a number of
neat convenience methods that make working with them pretty slick. For instance,
you can grab the image for a card with `.image()`:

{% endraw %}
![Chane Card Image]({{site.url}}/images/fab-chane-image.png)
{% raw %}

Or just render the card directly in Markdown:

{% endraw %}
![Prism Card Render]({{site.url}}/images/fab-prism-render.png)
{% raw %}

Thinking about checking how much a card is worth on TCGPlayer? Easy:

```python
print(prism.tcgplayer_url())
```

Wanna work with a card but only if it's currently legal to play in Blitz?

```python
if some_card.is_legal('B'):
  # maybe put it in a deck here ...
else:
  raise Exception(f'"{some_card.name}" is currently not legal in Blitz')
```

Next, we'll go into the deck building capabilities of the module.


## Building Decks

`fab` provides a special object to represent, and aid in the building of, player
decks called [Deck](https://fablib.readthedocs.io/decks/) (original, I know).
`Deck` objects contain not only the collection of cards within their "main" and
"side" decks, but also meta-information about the format the deck targets and
any arbitrary notes for using them. We can replicate our intended construction
of a Prism deck above using a `Deck` object like so:

```python
from fab import Deck

# First, we build our `Deck` object.
deck = Deck(name='Prism Classic Constructed Deck', hero=prism, format='CC')

# From there, it's super simple to grab the list of all currently legal cards
# that can be included in our deck.
supporting_cards = deck.filter_related(all_cards)

# We can manually build out our deck via appending cards to the appropriate deck
# field.
deck.cards.extend(
  supporting_cards.filter(name='Herald of Protection')
)
deck.inventory.extend(
  supporting_cards.filter(types=['Arms', 'Chest', 'Head', 'Legs'])
)
```

But what if you don't have _time_ to build a deck? Well `fab` provides a couple
of options for you. Firstly, we can instruct `fab` to build one for us via the
`auto_build()` method. This process is essentially random, but with some
tweakable target goals (see the [relevant
documentation](https://fablib.readthedocs.io/decks/#fab.deck.Deck.auto_build)
for more info):

```python
deck.auto_build(
  cards = supporting_cards,
  target_pitch_cost_difference = 50,
  target_power_defense_difference = 100
)
```

Finally, you can always pull a deck from [FaB DB](https://fabdb.net/). This can
be done like so:

```python
# Essentially returns a list of dictionaries containing FaB DB links and other
# useful info.
results = Deck.search_fabdb(prism, format='CC', kind='competitive', order='popular-all')

# Once you have a deck chosen, importing it into the library is as easy as the
# following!
deck = Deck.from_fabdb('https://fabdb.net/decks/kEXYdXDp')

# You can even render any Markdown notes attached to the deck!
deck.render_notes()
```

Okay this article is getting long - let's move on to the data analytics!


## Analyzing Cards

### Basic Statistics

`fab` provides easy access to basic statistical functions for `CardList` and
`Deck` objects. It can compute the _maximum_, _minimum_, _mean_, _median_,
_mode_, and _standard deviation_ for all numerical card values (`cost`,
`defense`, `health`, `intelligence`, `pitch`, and `power`), as well as some
additional data of potential use such as the number of _red_, _yellow_, and/or
_blue_ cards in a collection. Each of these computations may be performed
individually (ex `mean_cost()`) or collected all at once via the `statistics()`
method. Combined with the filtering and grouping methods, it's quite easy to
build up meaningful statistical queries:

```python
from fab import meta

# What is the mean power of all Runeblade attack cards that cost 0 resources?
answer = all_cards.filter(types='Runeblade').filter(types='Attack', cost=0).mean_power()

# How varied are the cost values of each hero class?
answer = {t, c.stdev_cost() for t, c in all_cards.filter(types=meta.CLASS_TYPES).group(by='types').items()}
```

`Deck` objects extend the workflows above by helping to pre-target cards for
computation. They also provide an overall `statistics()` method for quick deck
stats at a glance.

### Converting To Other Formats

Though it may be hard to believe, most other python modules don't have
first-hand support for working with `Card` or `CardList` objects. It became
apparent that the module should have the ability to convert to and from popular
data formats. For the moment, `fab` has the ability to convert `Card` objects
into `pandas` [Series](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/series.html)
objects, and `CardList` objects into `pandas`
[DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/frame.html) objects:


{% endraw %}
![DataFrame Example]({{site.url}}/images/fab-dataframe.png)
{% raw %}

I figure direct interoperability with `pandas` will suffice for the majority of
use cases for the moment, although I foresee supporting direct conversions to
other formats in the future as well.

### Graphical Analysis

Finally, `fab` provides some [graphical analysis
shortcuts](https://fablib.readthedocs.io/graphics/) via wrapper functions around
[Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/), which allows one to make some cool looking
graphs:

{% endraw %}
![Distribution of Attack Power by Class]({{site.url}}/images/fab-dist-plot.png)
{% raw %}


# Wrapping Up

So the TL;DR is that I absolutely love both the current state and potential of
_Flesh and Blood_ and wanted to leverage some of my skills to provide something
back to the community that I hope can help this game maintain its course into
becoming a true powerhouse like _Magic: The Gathering_ or _Yu-Gi-Oh_. Honestly
as I type this, I think it's pretty much already there. Everyone I have showed
the game to has had nothing but praise to give. My local community went from
essentially zero players to just shy of a dozen in a matter of a few weeks. I'm
happy to be part of a passionate, welcoming community for a _fun_ game.
